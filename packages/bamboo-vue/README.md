## What is bamboo-vue?

`bamboo-vue` is a collection of lightweight and flexible components for Vue 3. It is designed to be easy to use and type-safe, providing a solid foundation for building modern, responsive web applications.

The package uses the [`bamboo-core`](https://github.com/mrksbnc/bamboo/tree/main/packages/bamboo-core/README.md) package as it's core dependency and re-exports all the necessary values and types meant to be used by the package consumers.
