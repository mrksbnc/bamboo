# Theming

The Bamboo component library provides a flexible and consistent theming system to help you build beautiful, accessible interfaces.

## Key Theming Features

The theming system in Bamboo offers:

1. **Dark Mode Support** - All components automatically adapt to light and dark themes
2. **Consistent Sizing** - A unified size system across all components
3. **Accessibility-focused** - Color combinations designed for optimal contrast and readability
4. **Tailwind Integration** - Seamless integration with Tailwind CSS utilities

## Getting Started with Theming

To start using the Bamboo theming features:

1. Explore the [Dark Mode documentation](./dark-mode.md) to understand how to implement theme switching
2. Check the [Component Sizing documentation](./sizing.md) to learn about the consistent sizing system
3. Apply these principles to your application for a cohesive and polished UI

## Default Theme

Bamboo components use a default theme out of the box that follows modern design principles with a clean, minimal aesthetic:

- Subtle shadows and depth
- Neutral color palette with accent colors for emphasis
- Comfortable spacing and proportions
- Smooth transitions and interactions

## Customization Points

While Bamboo components look great with default styling, there are multiple ways to customize the appearance:

1. **Component Props** - Use variant, size, and color props to adapt components
2. **CSS Variables** - Override CSS variables for global theme adjustments
3. **Tailwind Classes** - Apply additional Tailwind classes to modify specific instances
4. **Dark Mode Classes** - Use `dark:` variants to customize dark mode appearance

## Theme Consistency Best Practices

For a professional and cohesive UI:

1. Choose a primary color and use it consistently for interactive elements
2. Maintain consistent spacing using the sizing system
3. Use dark mode appropriately for different user contexts
4. Test themes thoroughly for accessibility compliance

Explore the detailed documentation on [Dark Mode](./dark-mode.md) and [Component Sizing](./sizing.md) to make the most of the Bamboo theming system.
