# Theming

The Bamboo component library provides a flexible and consistent theming system to help you build beautiful, accessible interfaces.

## Key Theming Features

The theming system in Bamboo offers:

1. **Dark Mode Support** - All components automatically adapt to light and dark themes
2. **Consistent Sizing** - A unified size system across all components
3. **Accessibility-focused** - Color combinations designed for optimal contrast and readability
4. **Tailwind Integration** - Seamless integration with Tailwind CSS utilities

## Getting Started with Theming

To start using the Bamboo theming features:

1. Explore the [Dark Mode documentation](./dark-mode.md) to understand how to implement theme switching
2. Check the [Component Sizing documentation](./sizing.md)

## Default Theme

Bamboo components use a default theme out of the box that follows modern design principles with a clean, minimal aesthetic:

- Subtle shadows and depth
- Neutral color palette with accent colors for emphasis
- Comfortable spacing and proportions
- Smooth transitions and interactions

## Customization Points

While Bamboo components look great with default styling, there are multiple ways to customize the appearance:

1. **Component Props** - Use variant, size, and color props to adapt components
2. **CSS Variables** - Override CSS variables for global theme adjustments
3. **Tailwind Classes** - Apply additional Tailwind classes to modify specific instances
4. **Dark Mode Classes** - Use `dark:` variants to customize dark mode appearance
