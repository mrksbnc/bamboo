# Accessibility Service

The Accessibility Service provides utilities for managing accessibility features in the application. It handles keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader announcements.

## Methods

### `initializeAccessibility()`

Initializes accessibility features and event listeners.

```typescript
initializeAccessibility(): void
```

### `handleKeyboardNavigation(event: KeyboardEvent)`

Handles keyboard navigation events.

```typescript
handleKeyboardNavigation(event: KeyboardEvent): void
```

### `announceToScreenReader(message: string)`

Announces a message to screen readers.

```typescript
announceToScreenReader(message: string): void
```

### `setFocus(element: HTMLElement)`

Sets focus to a specific element.

```typescript
setFocus(element: HTMLElement): void
```

### `trapFocus(element: HTMLElement)`

Implements focus trapping for a specific element.

A focus trap is a technique used to prevent users from accidentally focusing on a specific element which should be outside of the reachable boundaries
during the current user interaction.

This method is typically used in modals or other interactive elements that should not be focusable by keyboard users.

```typescript
trapFocus(element: HTMLElement): void
```

## Usage Examples

```typescript
import { AccessibilityService } from '@/services';

// Initialize accessibility
AccessibilityService.instance.initializeAccessibility();

// Announce to screen reader
AccessibilityService.instance.announceToScreenReader('Form submitted successfully');

// Set focus
const button = document.querySelector('button');
AccessibilityService.instance.setFocus(button);

// Trap focus in modal
const modal = document.querySelector('.modal');
AccessibilityService.instance.trapFocus(modal);
```
